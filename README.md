This project uses Terraform to create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
It sets up both public and private subnets, and can serve as a base for deploying secure cloud architectures.

ðŸŽ¯ Aim
The aim of this project is to create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using Terraform.
The VPC includes both public and private subnets, which serve as the foundational infrastructure for deploying secure cloud applications and services.

ðŸ“˜ Overview
This project demonstrates how to use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles with Terraform to automate network provisioning on GCP.
It defines reusable configuration files that create cloud resources consistently and efficiently.
